 # Activity Generator
Welcome to the Bored API Activity Generator Website! This website is designed to provide you with a fun and random activity to do when you're feeling bored.

About the API
The website uses the Bored API (https://www.boredapi.com/api/activity) to retrieve information about various activities. The API returns three pieces of information about each activity:

activity: a description of the activity
type: the category of the activity (e.g. education, recreation, etc.)
participants: the number of people required for the activity
Features
A button that, when clicked, retrieves a random activity from the Bored API and displays it on the page.
